<td>Another Midrange killer Smartphone by Xiaomi<br/><br/>Major Highlights:<br/>� The Redmi 6 Pro sports a 5.84-inch full-HD+ display with a notch<br/>� Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 SoC<br/>� The phone is priced at Rs. 10,999 for the 3GB RAM variant (Start Point)<br/>� Battery of 4000 mAh and its Durability<br/>� The Tripple Slots<br/>� Dual AI Camera<br/><br/>Well in Redmi 6 Series you will get 3 Different Smartphones with different specs, and from all of them, Redmi 6 pro is most powerful and advanced (as said by Redmi India in their launch event).<br/><br/>Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro design:<br/>Being the most premium phone of the new Redmi 6 family, the Redmi 6 Pro has been given somewhat better materials, in the form of a metal backplate. However, the overall design isn�t too different from what we�ve already seen from Xiaomi at around this price point. This is a fairly thick phone, and it&#39;s a bit hefty too, but it�s manageable. The buttons have good feedback without being noisy, and on the left side, you get a single tray which can hold two SIM cards and a separate microSD card. Something worth noting is that the Redmi 6 Pro does not support dual 4G VoLTE, which means that only one SIM can connect to a 4G network at a time, The placement of ports is good. The mono speaker is on the bottom right, so chances of blocking it when using the phone in landscape mode are slim. The headphone socket is placed on the top, and you also get an infrared (IR) emitter which can be used to control IR appliances through the Mi Remote app.<br/><br/>Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro specifications and software:<br/>The phone uses Qualcomm�s Snapdragon 625 SoC, which is a couple of years old now but is still a capable chip for general tasks. Gaming performance isn�t great, as some popular games like PUBG, and asphalt default to the lowest graphics settings, and even then, gameplay isn�t smooth. Our unit was running on a pre-release version of its MIUI software, which prevented us from running most benchmarks.<br/><br/>Storage Options:<br/>Well I am impressed with the Xiaomi as they provided triple Slot in sim tray (2 for nano sim &amp; one for SD card)<br/><br/>Heating Issues:<br/>Well, I do not find any heating issues in this phone while playing games like PubG and Asphalt.<br/><br/>Camera in Redmi 6 pro:<br/>The rear 12-megapixel camera has a f/2.2 aperture with PDAF. Autofocus was decently quick in good light. There�s auto-HDR, which did a good job of balancing the exposure in our experience. We observed good detail in landscape shots in daylight, and colours were pleasing too. The main sensor stumbled a bit with macros, as it simply wasn&#39;t able to resolve finer detail. The white balance was a bit of a hit or a miss in close-ups, and we often found ourselves having to tap-to-focus to get the white balance back on track. Saving HDR images takes a good couple of seconds in daylight. I would be very happy if they have provided the Flash in Portrait Mode, still, you can Tap on Torch icon to switch, on the torch, you will get the flash in Portrait Mode.<br/><br/>Battery in Redmi 6 Pro:<br/>Battery life is one of the strong suits of the Redmi 6 Pro. The 4000mAh battery easily lasted us a full day and a bit more on one charge. Playing heavy games didn&#39;t drain the battery too much either. In a single round of PUBG (around 30 minutes), in which we survived till the very end, we recorded a drop of around seven percent, which is not bad. In our internal video loop test, we got a runtime of 16 hours and 45 minutes, which is very good. The Redmi 6 Pro doesn�t support fast charging, but the bundled 10W adapter gave us roughly a 55 percent charge in an hour, and it took us roughly 2 hours and 35 minutes to charge it completely from zero<br/>Well before buying this phone I have heard many issues regarding inbuilt Advertisement in Xiaomi devices, and I checked that too in my previous Xiaomi phone which I am using since 2 Years. And actually, I found inbuilt ads in those phones. You will see ads in inbuilt developers apps like MI Apps, Mi Music, Mi Videos, Security, File Manager, Themes, sometimes you will see full-screen ads which are really irritating for Mi Fans, but there is a cooler way to stop those ads those who wanted to know contact me.<br/><br/>Final Verdict:<br/>Well for the people who want a notch Display, Big Battery and Descent Camera you they can buy this phone blindly.<br/>Suggestion for Xiaomi India: You should stop those inbuilt Ads present in your devices because we customers don�t find those ads Valuable. Because we are not Surfing any website where many ads are present. So please stop it.<br/><br/>Note: Pics Included in this Review are captured by Redmi Note 3</td>

<td>Redmi has always have been the the king of budget segment.And yet another they gave us the Redmi 6 pro.It&#39;s a beautifully designed,strong and durable.And the camera is awesome just like the Note 5 pro,Display is crisp and the notch is in good shape, means it does take whole screen.Sound quality is clear and loud.But the headset experience is awesome.The Battery is 4000mah which is crazily optimized.In heavy useage it will give 2 day and a half in normal useage it give 3 days.And best thing is the inbuild Mi sercurity which loaded with features.You don&#39;t need third security apps.And the phone do charge little faster on it&#39;s stock adapter.Atleast 2hrs and 45mins.As it&#39;s a Qualcomm Chipset.<br/><br/>Verdict: The Base model is actually the Value for money deal. 3/32 GB.<br/>I have been using the Redmi 6 pro for 3 weeks now.

<td>Guys, just don&#39;t buy Redmi 6 pro for now atleast. Got it delivered yesterday, I have both Gold and Black Variant. Black looks nice. But wait, It&#39;s just an unpolished product. The Pinch to fill the video doesn&#39;t work in Mi Video app. The left edge remains like this &quot;|&quot; and right &quot;)&quot; even this happens in Youtube. Both apps leave way too much on both sides if I let it to original. Making it a 5 inch screen display. There is No Indian City name in Time Zone, it&#39;s shown as GMT+5:30. It automatically detects the time zone as China. Why?? Has to change time, manually!!!! Then, How the heck they say that this is Made in India. While setting up the phone, the Limitless theme has Icons written in chinese. The camera app is inconsistent. The so called AI doesn&#39;t seem to be going well with SD625. My friend has RN5 pro. I think they both have same app. But his camera shows icon within screen top as if its going to shoot it with Flash or HDR. But, no this is just a crap..<br/><br/>So, a 5.84 screen display is just a waste if I cann&#39;t watch video to its limit. What&#39;s the purpose served by notch then and what am I supposed to do with that 5.84 inch screen???? No more notification icons in the notification bar, No more connection speed and battery percentage too, until you drop that notification panel. Stupid MI !!!!</td>

<td>Please don&#39;t buy!!<br/><br/>Horrible phone from Xiaomi!!<br/><br/>The phone is just for people who like showing off the new iPhone notch design. The phone uses an outdated processor and lags terrible in term of performance. When we use more than 4apps at a time, the phone will get hanged and you will be forced to restart the phone. Watching videos for more than 20mins the phone gets extrmely heated and you will have to put it to stanby fir a while before resarting the use of the phone. Very bad multi-tasking. The build quality is okay, but not as good as other budget phone. A flat drop on the front screen side if hit hardly will crack the screen. The front camera is extremely poor and has been downgraded and doesn&#39;t produce even a decent quality picture. Selfie lovers, please don&#39;t even buy this phone you will get a heart ache after looking at your pix. The rear camera picture quality is average and is very unlike of xiaomi.<br/><br/>On the other side, the basic things like the output from the speaker phone and and the earphone are extremely poor and distorted...<br/><br/>The only con is a decent screen, however that is contributed by low quality video while played in amazon or netflix..<br/><br/>Had complained to Amazon on the above low quality issues, unfortunately Amazon is not willing to listen, they are saying technically the phone is working and hence it can&#39;t taken back.. Unfortunately, in this case Amazon has put its sellers over it buyers who are their bread and butter. Hope Amazon listens to my complaint here and takes measures to improve their service... Just to put things into perspective, an average 6-7k phone is sold at an extremely abnoxiously at a high price of 11k. You can find many better phone at this high price. Please stop buying this phone. Thanks for reading. Extremely sadened on buying this phone...</td>

<td>Phone is really nice and good looking.<br/>I think I got a defective one. Because there is a blue colour appears on the side of the screen. You can see it on the image shown below. I don&#39;t know I&#39;m the one who facing this or is it a common problem. Plz let me know if you&#39;re facing the same. Also there is some touch issues when we using keyboard for typing. The typing is not smooth and it lag a lot. But the problem appears only on keyboard. I don&#39;t know wether it&#39;s a physical problem or a software problem. I wish the replacement phone will don&#39;t have these problems. Dear MI team you should consider the blue colour problem on resmi 6 pro display. It may affect your smartphone marketing. Dear MI Please make quality product as shows in your TV Advertising. I&#39;m waiting to get the replacement. Amazon lag in replacement policy without a hand to hand replacement. Hate to purchase from Amazon</td>

<td>Hey guys this is TECHBORED! and this is unboxing and also will adding some camera shots.<br/>-----------------------<br/>IN THE BOX<br/>-----------------------<br/>1. Manuals with warranty information.<br/>2. Charging cable.<br/>3. 5V 2A power adapter.<br/>4. Transparent TPU case.<br/>5. Redmi 6 Pro.<br/>----------<br/>DESIGN<br/>----------<br/>1. The transparent case fits well and is a perfect fit. Gives nice feel in hands.<br/>2. It comes with a notch that is small and I really liked it, At least Xiaomi has tried to cut out the bezels at this budget segment.<br/>3. It sports a FULL HD + display with that 19:9 aspect ratio.<br/>4. On the top of the phone there is this infrared sensor secondary noise cancellation microphone and wow there is this 3.5mm headphone jack. Always happy to see this port.<br/>5. Now moving to the button than there is this micro USB port situated with microphone and the speaker that is loud but decent sounding speaker.<br/>6. Redmi 6 Pro body is made up of both metal and plastic. So this is only where metal is used but on the top bottom and on the sides it is plastic. Also the sim tray is made up of plastic. Buttons are made up of metal thats nice and gives very nice feedback.<br/>----------------------------<br/>DUAL 4G STANDBY<br/>----------------------------<br/>There is DUAL SIM with dual 4G standby so you can use both sims on 4G at same time. And here is a<br/>good thing that I liked about this and it is that it has dedicated Micro SD card slot.<br/>---------------------------<br/>FACE UNLOCK<br/>---------------------------<br/>There is also the finger print sensor that is fast enough to unlock and it also come with this face unlock that is pretty fast and I think it is very much secure. At least it will not be unlocked with your pictures.<br/>-----------------------<br/>CAMERA SETUP<br/>-----------------------<br/>1. The best thing that Xiaomi has put in to this Redmi 6 Pro and it is the same camera setup as on Redmi Note 5 Pro. So it has 12Mp with 5mp dual camera setup with aperture of 2.2 and the single LED flash in the middle. Just now I cannot tell in detail that how how camera performs but I have included some shots that are taken on Redmi 6 Pro and I think they are nice, decent and are almost the the same as on Redmi Note 5 Pro.<br/>2. This camera setup can record upto 1080p videos at 30fps and it supports EIS and the videos are not much shaky and EIS performs well. Where as on the front is 5MP with aperture of 2.0 camera and its decent.<br/>-------------------<br/>HARDWARE<br/>-------------------<br/>1. So it is powered with the same old Snaprdragon 625 and I think think that it is good for the budget smartphones for now and it performs well on this smartphone.<br/>2. Redmi 6 Pro is backed up with 4000mAh battery that is great.<br/>3. Running on Android 8.1 Oreo and on the top of that there is custom MIUI 9. It will soon get a stable update of MIUI10.<br/>4. So the Redmi 6 pro comes in 3GB RAM with 32GB internal mermory and 4GB RAM with 64 GB internal memory variants.</td>

<td>after using two weeks i just analyse that it is a average phone in this price catagory. price should not be more than 10,000/- for this phone.<br/>here i analyse some pros and cons of this phone after countinious using of this phone.<br/>PROS:-<br/>1.screen resolution is preety good 1080 x 2280 pixels, colours contrast also very impressive.<br/>2.two days battery backup if you not playing heavy games on it like PUBG.<br/>3.Snapdragon 625 is old but till now it&#39;s performance is awsm ,you did not face any lag in games in low graphic setting.<br/>4.camera pictures quality is good, also portrait mode captures the good depth effect in photos but only in Day light condition in night you will face high noice in pictures<br/>5.front facing camera also have AI depth effect it not too much good but you can take good selfy in day light condition.<br/>6.process optimization in this phone is good.<br/>7.there are a little notch which increase the looks and design of phone.<br/>CONS:-<br/>1.one thing i hate in this phone is its notifaction bar, you will not get all notification on top bar, every time you need to scroll down the ntification bar to see app notifications. net speed meter is also not shown and no whatsapp icon notification on the top of the bar. because of the notch on the screen. Mi company should needs to fix these minaor issues by new updatess.<br/>2.Downloading process in background is little bit slow in this phone as compare to other redmi phones.<br/>3. video recording quality of this phone is not good.<br/>4.only 5MP front facing camera and quality is very average. in this price segment there are many phones avilabe which have better front cameras.</td>

<td>Overall Phone seems to be good with performance perspective under this range category. Do not buy if you are looking for wider screen and thinner phone. I felt Y2 would have been better choice in the same range which I already brought one for the family.<br/><br/>Not satisfied with the looks, screen size and it is a fatty phone.</td>

<td>after using two weeks i just analyse that it is a average phone in this price catagory. price should not be more than 10,000/- for this phone.<br/>here i analyse some pros and cons of this phone after countinious using of this phone.<br/>PROS:-<br/>1.screen resolution is preety good 1080 x 2280 pixels, colours contrast also very impressive.<br/>2.two days battery backup if you not playing heavy games on it like PUBG.<br/>3.Snapdragon 625 is old but till now it&#39;s performance is awsm ,you did not face any lag in games in low graphic setting.<br/>4.camera pictures quality is good, also portrait mode captures the good depth effect in photos but only in Day light condition in night you will face high noice in pictures<br/>5.front facing camera also have AI depth effect it not too much good but you can take good selfy in day light condition.<br/>6.process optimization in this phone is good.<br/>7.there are a little notch which increase the looks and design of phone.<br/>CONS:-<br/>1.one thing i hate in this phone is its notifaction bar, you will not get all notification on top bar, every time you need to scroll down the ntification bar to see app notifications. net speed meter is also not shown and no whatsapp icon notification on the top of the bar. because of the notch on the screen. Mi company should needs to fix these minaor issues by new updatess.<br/>2.Downloading process in background is little bit slow in this phone as compare to other redmi phones.<br/>3. video recording quality of this phone is not good.<br/>4.only 5MP front facing camera and quality is very average. in this price segment there are many phones avilabe which have better front cameras.</td>

<td>Battery</td>
<td>Redmi Note4, Note5, now 6pro..It seems the older the model the better was the performance as I used all 3 models in the line. The notch design, hides the battery % and network speed, one has to pull down a bit to see these 2 things. Note 5 and 6pro both have a common issue-- after switching the swipe up (to unlock) does not work smoothly every time. The escape is to switch off the swipe up feature. After Note4, in the newer models the length of USB cable has become shorter, whichis a problem if you are little away from the plug point. How much cost does Xiaomi saves by shortening the cable? 6pro came with a smaller ejection tool, additional cost saving by cutting 2gm of metal. The front flash if Note5 has been removed in 6pro. These manufacturers seem to be idiots and fooling public by launching new models without any real additional feature or improvement. Anyway, its an OK phone for 10,000 (3GB/32GB). For 11,000 a customer expects a little more, and Xiaomi disappoints here.</td>

Infact that makes phone looks smaller than 5.84 as notch is also included in size.<br/><br/>There are better options available in same price range.</td>
