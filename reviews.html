<p>Another Midrange killer Smartphone by Xiaomi<br/><br/>Major Highlights:<br/>� The Redmi 6 Pro sports a 5.84-inch full-HD+ display with a notch<br/>� Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 SoC<br/>� The phone is priced at Rs. 10,999 for the 3GB RAM variant (Start Point)<br/>� Battery of 4000 mAh and its Durability<br/>� The Tripple Slots<br/>� Dual AI Camera<br/><br/>Well in Redmi 6 Series you will get 3 Different Smartphones with different specs, and from all of them, Redmi 6 pro is most powerful and advanced (as said by Redmi India in their launch event).<br/><br/>Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro design:<br/>Being the most premium phone of the new Redmi 6 family, the Redmi 6 Pro has been given somewhat better materials, in the form of a metal backplate. However, the overall design isn�t too different from what we�ve already seen from Xiaomi at around this price point. This is a fairly thick phone, and it&#39;s a bit hefty too, but it�s manageable. The buttons have good feedback without being noisy, and on the left side, you get a single tray which can hold two SIM cards and a separate microSD card. Something worth noting is that the Redmi 6 Pro does not support dual 4G VoLTE, which means that only one SIM can connect to a 4G network at a time, The placement of ports is good. The mono speaker is on the bottom right, so chances of blocking it when using the phone in landscape mode are slim. The headphone socket is placed on the top, and you also get an infrared (IR) emitter which can be used to control IR appliances through the Mi Remote app.<br/><br/>Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro specifications and software:<br/>The phone uses Qualcomm�s Snapdragon 625 SoC, which is a couple of years old now but is still a capable chip for general tasks. Gaming performance isn�t great, as some popular games like PUBG, and asphalt default to the lowest graphics settings, and even then, gameplay isn�t smooth. Our unit was running on a pre-release version of its MIUI software, which prevented us from running most benchmarks.<br/><br/>Storage Options:<br/>Well I am impressed with the Xiaomi as they provided triple Slot in sim tray (2 for nano sim &amp; one for SD card)<br/><br/>Heating Issues:<br/>Well, I do not find any heating issues in this phone while playing games like PubG and Asphalt.<br/><br/>Camera in Redmi 6 pro:<br/>The rear 12-megapixel camera has a f/2.2 aperture with PDAF. Autofocus was decently quick in good light. There�s auto-HDR, which did a good job of balancing the exposure in our experience. We observed good detail in landscape shots in daylight, and colours were pleasing too. The main sensor stumbled a bit with macros, as it simply wasn&#39;t able to resolve finer detail. The white balance was a bit of a hit or a miss in close-ups, and we often found ourselves having to tap-to-focus to get the white balance back on track. Saving HDR images takes a good couple of seconds in daylight. I would be very happy if they have provided the Flash in Portrait Mode, still, you can Tap on Torch icon to switch, on the torch, you will get the flash in Portrait Mode.<br/><br/>Battery in Redmi 6 Pro:<br/>Battery life is one of the strong suits of the Redmi 6 Pro. The 4000mAh battery easily lasted us a full day and a bit more on one charge. Playing heavy games didn&#39;t drain the battery too much either. In a single round of PUBG (around 30 minutes), in which we survived till the very end, we recorded a drop of around seven percent, which is not bad. In our internal video loop test, we got a runtime of 16 hours and 45 minutes, which is very good. The Redmi 6 Pro doesn�t support fast charging, but the bundled 10W adapter gave us roughly a 55 percent charge in an hour, and it took us roughly 2 hours and 35 minutes to charge it completely from zero<br/>Well before buying this phone I have heard many issues regarding inbuilt Advertisement in Xiaomi devices, and I checked that too in my previous Xiaomi phone which I am using since 2 Years. And actually, I found inbuilt ads in those phones. You will see ads in inbuilt developers apps like MI Apps, Mi Music, Mi Videos, Security, File Manager, Themes, sometimes you will see full-screen ads which are really irritating for Mi Fans, but there is a cooler way to stop those ads those who wanted to know contact me.<br/><br/>Final Verdict:<br/>Well for the people who want a notch Display, Big Battery and Descent Camera you they can buy this phone blindly.<br/>Suggestion for Xiaomi India: You should stop those inbuilt Ads present in your devices because we customers don�t find those ads Valuable. Because we are not Surfing any website where many ads are present. So please stop it.<br/><br/>Note: Pics Included in this Review are captured by Redmi Note 3</p>

<p>Redmi has always have been the the king of budget segment.And yet another they gave us the Redmi 6 pro.It&#39;s a beautifully designed,strong and durable.And the camera is awesome just like the Note 5 pro,Display is crisp and the notch is in good shape, means it does take whole screen.Sound quality is clear and loud.But the headset experience is awesome.The Battery is 4000mah which is crazily optimized.In heavy useage it will give 2 day and a half in normal useage it give 3 days.And best thing is the inbuild Mi sercurity which loaded with features.You don&#39;t need third security apps.And the phone do charge little faster on it&#39;s stock adapter.Atleast 2hrs and 45mins.As it&#39;s a Qualcomm Chipset.<br/><br/>Verdict: The Base model is actually the Value for money deal. 3/32 GB.<br/>I have been using the Redmi 6 pro for 3 weeks now. This is totally tested.</p>

<p>Over prised by at least around Rs.1000/- Low light photos are bad. Only one SIM support VOLTE.<br/>Good things are best sound, good display, smooth touch, excellent battery life management, compact, nice photos and videos under good light. It never gets over heated while using or charging. I don&#39;t play games. I like MIUI. I have already Redmi 4 A (Rs.6000/-only) using for more than 14 months working superbly. I have good opinion about Redmi mobiles.</p>

<p>The product is great with quite good features. I am great fan of xiaomi and I have been always using Xiaomi phones. But I am disappointed with mobile designing of Xiaomi as most of all the lower range and mid range phones have same design. Xiaomi always being giving with so many features but being realme entering in market Xiaomi has to be more creative to attract more indian customers.</p>
